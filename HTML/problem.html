        <h1>What's the Problem?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            This page is about the problem we have chosen to solve.
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, many teens find themselves lacking in information that they could use to protect themselves from
            cyber threats.
            These threats can come in the form of hackers, phishing or even problems such as digital identity theft. One
            of the main reasons
            that people fall victim to these cybercrimes is due to a lack of digital literacy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore we, the creators of this website have found a way to combat cyber threats with one thing that
            everyone has: Knowledge!
            Our website focuses on educating youth on how to keep their online information safe and how to detect
            threats that may arise.
            As with preventing viruses you need a anti-virus client. Most people have this information to protect their
            computers but
            there are many other solutions that people dont know. It is astounding how many people fall prey to cyber
            threats when they could
            have been prevented easily! We hope that you use the information in our solutions page and for you to have
            sufficient knowledge in this area.
